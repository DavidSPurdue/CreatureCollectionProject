      "description": "Bugbears are large and hairy goblinoids known for their strength. Bugbears are very notably hairy compared to their other goblinoid brothers. They are typically the biggest members within any goblinoid gathering, and serve as guards. it should be noted that while bugbears do have natural claws, they are particularly sharp, leading to them mostly using weapons acquired from their victims. Of course, due to how only few adventurers are reckless enough to go so deep into a goblinoid lair that they would encounter a bugbear, the weapons that each bugbear wield are typically very well-worn and battered.",
      "description_2": "It is certainly interesting that when researching bugbears, most records describe either the brutal manner in which they manage to defeat their foes or ways to combat groups of bugbears(the latter typically prefaces itself with paragraphs of preamble discussing why this is a terrible idea). There are very few accounts of the culture of bugbears, with what few records there are noting their apparent brutality and idiocy.",

Notably, unlike normal wolves, dire wolves can be found isolated from their packs. In addition. dire wolves are significantly more aggressive than normal wolves. Once a dire wolf sees you, it's highly likely that it will attack.",
      "description_2": "They are especially know for the enhanced strength and durability compared to their normal wolf counter parts. Dire wolves are also incredibly tacticians who will utilize their numbers to overwhelm prey. There have been certain records which indicate that families of hill giants have domesticated dire wolves as guard dogs. It should also be noted that attempting this as a normal humanoid is incredibly dangerous and will most like end in an untimely demise. /n Do NOT attempt to pet.",

While there are multiple notable accounts of humanoids befriending dragons or at the very least able to come to an agreement that didn't end in the death of the humanoid. These accounts however, are outweighed significantly by the amount of bodies found either directly trampled by dragons or in towns completely destroyed by a dragon. Dragons are incredibly intelligent creatures, are known to use deception and manipulation to get what they want.",
      "description_2": "Dragons typically grow to around 120ft long with a wingspan of 135ft. Their scales are generally incredibly tough, and, depending on the type of the dragon, can be resistant a variety of elements. Dragons are very well known for their breath attacks, able to devastate entire villages with just one breath. They are also able to utlize their claws and teeth, though normally they can get by with just stepping on whichever adventurer was unfortuante enough to cross their path.",

It is, however, incredibly notable that certain hobgoblins have been able to integrate themselves within human societies.
